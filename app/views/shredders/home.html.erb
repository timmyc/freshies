  <h3 class="aside">About Cone Patrol</h3>
  <p>I heart skiing.  I double heart skiing powder.  "Cone Patrol" is a term a ski buddy gave to hiking the cone at <a href="http://mtbachelor.com">Mt. Bachelor</a> prior to opening for freshiez.  Born from that tradition is <em>conepatrol.com</em>, a way for you &ndash; the fellow shredder, to get powder alerts sent to your phone via text.</p>
  <p>So ditch the snow phone, and setup a <em>conepatrol</em> alert to shout at you when the goods have dropped.  See you on the cone! &ndash; Timmy</p>
  <p>If you need help with anything powder alert related, please contact us on Twitter or over on Facebook</p>
  <p>Conepatrol is sponsored by the fine folks at <a href="http://mtbachelor.com">Mt. Bachelor</a>.</p>
